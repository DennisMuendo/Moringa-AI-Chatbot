Technology advances have made it much easier to amass data in huge quantities. Capitalizing on this data helps to create value and growth, which is why organizations are investing in people and technological capabilities to extract greater value from data. The digital and data revolution provides massive opportunities for finance functions and accounting professionals as you will understand in Stephen\u2019s story.Tell us about yourself.I am Stephen Gathai, a finance professional with over 10 years of experience. I\u2019m also a Certified Professional Accountant (CPA-K) and Certified Investment and Financial Analyst (CIFA), currently working in audit. At Moringa, I am aData Science Part-timestudent and we\u2019re in Phase 2,\u00a0tackling statistics.You work in audit and have a background in finance. What made you decide to study Data Science?In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the contribution of data scientists plays a pivotal role in driving innovations and success. Currently, auditing has shifted from being qualitative to quantitative, where the use of data is vast. I work in the manufacturing industry where there is a lot of data to sift through. All the data is to be audited and presented with well-backed support. That gave me the drive to study Data Science since before, I could use Excel to conduct my analysis which is time-consuming and inefficient. Learning science-based tools as I am in Data Science enables me to undertake my work with efficiency. With the skills I am gaining, I can comfortably do data elimination, increase my sample sizes and work with huge sets of data with ease.I believe that you did research before settling on Moringa for the Data Science program. So what made you choose Moringa over other institutions?I was certain that I wanted to pursueData Sciencebecause of how it would benefit my career. I searched online and checked professional social networking sites such as Linkedin and what intrigued me was that Moringa stood out. The Data Science professionals that I follow on Linkedin have a background in Moringa hence my interest. I reached out to them and they gave me the confidence that joining Moringa would be a stepping stone for my career. This far, I believe that I made the right decision.Have you worked on any project now that you are in phase 2? If you have, what has been the highlight of the project?I have, in phases 0 and 1, I learned Data Engineering,Data Visualization with Python\u2013 things I did not know. I have been able to apply the knowledge learned at work and the advantage I have is that we are not limited to the tools we can use. In matters of data at work,  I would previously liaise with our IT team which would take time to query and analyze data, and would sometimes be manipulated. I recently learned SQL that has enabled me to enjoy aspects of my work that involve querying data to figure out what it means, and talking to people way up in the organization and telling them what the data says the smart decisions are.I\u2019m thrilled that I can also do Data Visualization which can be understood by people with non-technical backgrounds. I am eager to learn more about data collection, data mining, and forecasting \u2013 skills that will come in handy at work.What are some career aspirations you have once you graduate?Allow me to paint a picture of our class. We are 84 and as the class representative, I interact with most students. Throughout our group discussions, the classmates that work in statistics pose real-life questions that require us to apply the knowledge learned in class. We thrive on a collaborative spirit when we work together to solve complex problems as we apply the knowledge we have gained to real-life situations. Doing this has broadened my view on the career choices I can make with my skills. I\u2019m halfway into the course in Phase 2, and I believe that by the time I\u2019m in Phase 5, I will be an exceptional Data Scientist.Once I graduate, I will consider venturing into data-driven audit consultancy. Career options abound.How would you describe your learning experience at Moringa?Having gone through 8-4-4 and now as a professional, I realize that a lot of knowledge taught to us back then is irrelevant and was to be utilized in passing exams \u2013 as the content lacked a practical aspect. The organization of classes atMoringais impressive. There are weekly lectures, stand-ups, streamlined communication channels between the Technical Mentors (TMs) and students through Slack, and peer breakout sessions where we have our blockers solved.Classes start with the TMs inquiring how people are fairing and depending on the responses, they assess how best to conduct the class. There are also feedback sessions where there the TMs incorporate the feedback received into their teaching and classroom interaction with the students.Knowing that we are listened to is motivating and gives me the oomph to power through. I\u2019m a family man who is also a working professional, so despite the challenging course, I am determined to excel in my studies because I know that the knowledge I\u2019m learning is equipping me into a well-rounded finance and data science professional.What would you tell someone who would like to pursue a career in Data Science?I would tell them to first enroll at Moringa and secondly, we are in the 21st century and data has become the lifeblood of the digital age. Businesses across industries require people with data analytics skills who are prepared to challenge norms.An undersold aspect of this field is just how versatile the skills are. Even though a lot of people are gunning for \u201cdata scientist\u201d jobs, there are literally hundreds of thousands of jobs right now seeking professionals with data literacy as part of their repertoire. For anyone interested in Data Science, I\u2019d say definitely go for it.How can people reach you for mentorship or career guidance?I\u2019m open to mentorship, find me on LinkedIn asStephen Gathaior send me an email via gathaistephen@gmail.com.

Enjoy the read!ceciliaJune 22, 2023Read MoreFacebookLinkedInTwitterWhatsappPinterestAs The Economist aptly put it in 2017, the world\u2019s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data. Technology advances have made it much easier to amass data in huge quantities. Capitalizing on this data helps to create value and growth, which is why organizations are investing in people and technological capabilities to extract greater value from data. The digital and data revolution provides massive opportunities for finance functions and accounting professionals as you will understand in Stephen\u2019s story.Tell us about yourself.I am Stephen Gathai, a finance professional with over 10 years of experience. I\u2019m also a Certified Professional Accountant (CPA-K) and Certified Investment and Financial Analyst (CIFA), currently working in audit. At Moringa, I am aData Science Part-timestudent and we\u2019re in Phase 2,\u00a0tackling statistics.You work in audit and have a background in finance. What made you decide to study Data Science?In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the contribution of data scientists plays a pivotal role in driving innovations and success. Currently, auditing has shifted from being qualitative to quantitative, where the use of data is vast. I work in the manufacturing industry where there is a lot of data to sift through. All the data is to be audited and presented with well-backed support. That gave me the drive to study Data Science since before, I could use Excel to conduct my analysis which is time-consuming and inefficient. Learning science-based tools as I am in Data Science enables me to undertake my work with efficiency. With the skills I am gaining, I can comfortably do data elimination, increase my sample sizes and work with huge sets of data with ease.I believe that you did research before settling on Moringa for the Data Science program. So what made you choose Moringa over other institutions?I was certain that I wanted to pursueData Sciencebecause of how it would benefit my career. I searched online and checked professional social networking sites such as Linkedin and what intrigued me was that Moringa stood out. The Data Science professionals that I follow on Linkedin have a background in Moringa hence my interest. I reached out to them and they gave me the confidence that joining Moringa would be a stepping stone for my career. This far, I believe that I made the right decision.Have you worked on any project now that you are in phase 2? If you have, what has been the highlight of the project?I have, in phases 0 and 1, I learned Data Engineering,Data Visualization with Python\u2013 things I did not know. I have been able to apply the knowledge learned at work and the advantage I have is that we are not limited to the tools we can use. In matters of data at work,  I would previously liaise with our IT team which would take time to query and analyze data, and would sometimes be manipulated. I recently learned SQL that has enabled me to enjoy aspects of my work that involve querying data to figure out what it means, and talking to people way up in the organization and telling them what the data says the smart decisions are.I\u2019m thrilled that I can also do Data Visualization which can be understood by people with non-technical backgrounds. I am eager to learn more about data collection, data mining, and forecasting \u2013 skills that will come in handy at work.What are some career aspirations you have once you graduate?Allow me to paint a picture of our class. We are 84 and as the class representative, I interact with most students. Throughout our group discussions, the classmates that work in statistics pose real-life questions that require us to apply the knowledge learned in class. We thrive on a collaborative spirit when we work together to solve complex problems as we apply the knowledge we have gained to real-life situations. Doing this has broadened my view on the career choices I can make with my skills. I\u2019m halfway into the course in Phase 2, and I believe that by the time I\u2019m in Phase 5, I will be an exceptional Data Scientist.Once I graduate, I will consider venturing into data-driven audit consultancy. Career options abound.How would you describe your learning experience at Moringa?Having gone through 8-4-4 and now as a professional, I realize that a lot of knowledge taught to us back then is irrelevant and was to be utilized in passing exams \u2013 as the content lacked a practical aspect. The organization of classes atMoringais impressive. There are weekly lectures, stand-ups, streamlined communication channels between the Technical Mentors (TMs) and students through Slack, and peer breakout sessions where we have our blockers solved.Classes start with the TMs inquiring how people are fairing and depending on the responses, they assess how best to conduct the class. There are also feedback sessions where there the TMs incorporate the feedback received into their teaching and classroom interaction with the students.Knowing that we are listened to is motivating and gives me the oomph to power through. I\u2019m a family man who is also a working professional, so despite the challenging course, I am determined to excel in my studies because I know that the knowledge I\u2019m learning is equipping me into a well-rounded finance and data science professional.What would you tell someone who would like to pursue a career in Data Science?I would tell them to first enroll at Moringa and secondly, we are in the 21st century and data has become the lifeblood of the digital age. Businesses across industries require people with data analytics skills who are prepared to challenge norms.An undersold aspect of this field is just how versatile the skills are. Even though a lot of people are gunning for \u201cdata scientist\u201d jobs, there are literally hundreds of thousands of jobs right now seeking professionals with data literacy as part of their repertoire. For anyone interested in Data Science, I\u2019d say definitely go for it.How can people reach you for mentorship or career guidance?I\u2019m open to mentorship, find me on LinkedIn asStephen Gathaior send me an email via gathaistephen@gmail.com.

    "FacebookLinkedInTwitterWhatsappPinterestObject-Relational Mapping(ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. When talking about ORM, most people are referring to alibrarythat implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase \u201can ORM\u201d.An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don\u2019t use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an object in the same language you\u2019re using.For example, here is a completely imaginary case with a pseudo language:You have a book class, you want to retrieve all the books of which the author is \u201cbiko\u201d. Manually, you would do something like that:book_list = new List();\nsql = \"SELECT book FROM library WHERE author = 'biko'\";\ndata = query(sql); // I over simplify ...\nwhile (row = data.next())\n{\n     book = new Book();\n     book.setAuthor(row.get('author');\n     book_list.add(book);\n}SQLAlchemySQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.Managing the state of your data is crucial for robust applications, and SQLAlchemy ORM offers a powerful toolkit for handling this with elegance and efficiency. \ud83d\udcbcIn SQLAlchemy, the ORM layer helps us bridge the gap between the relational database and our Python code, making it seamless to work with database records as Python objects. \ud83d\udc0dKey points on state management with SQLAlchemy ORM:Identity Map Pattern: SQLAlchemy keeps track of objects in a unit of work using the Identity Map pattern. This ensures that each database row is represented by a single Python object within a session.Session State: TheSessionin SQLAlchemy acts as a staging area for all changes before committing them to the database. Understanding and managing session states is vital for a smooth workflow.Dirty Tracking: SQLAlchemy automatically tracks changes to objects and only updates the fields that have been modified. This minimizes unnecessary database updates, optimizing performance.Unit of Work Pattern: SQLAlchemy employs the Unit of Work pattern to coordinate changes and transactions, making it easier to manage complex operations involving multiple objects.Flushing and Committing: Explicitly flushing the session synchronizes changes with the database, and committing finalizes the transaction. Understanding when to flush and commit is essential for data integrity.Events and Hooks: SQLAlchemy provides a rich set of events and hooks, allowing customization of state management behaviors to suit specific application needs.Assume you have aUsermodel representing users in a database:from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Sequence\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\n# Define the User model\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('user_id_seq'), primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String(50))\n    age = Column(Integer)\n\n# Create an SQLite in-memory database and bind the engine\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')\n\n# Create the 'users' table in the database\nBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\n\n# Create a Session class to interact with the database\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()Now, let\u2019s explore state management:# Create a new user and add it to the session\nnew_user = User(name='John Doe', age=25)\nsession.add(new_user)\n\n# At this point, the user is in the 'Pending' state, not yet committed to the database\n\n# Query the user (this will trigger a flush to the database)\nqueried_user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()\n\n# The queried_user is now in the 'Persistent' state, representing a database record\n\n# Modify the user's age\nqueried_user.age = 26\n\n# At this point, SQLAlchemy has marked the user as 'Dirty' because it has been modified\n\n# Commit the changes to the database\nsession.commit()\n\n# Now, the changes are saved to the database, and the user is in the 'Committed' state\n\n# The session is now in a 'Clean' state, and the user is no longer marked as 'Dirty'In this example:Pending:When a new user is added to the session, it is in a pending state.Persistent:After querying a user from the database, it becomes persistent.Dirty:If you modify a persistent object, it becomes dirty.Committed:After committing changes, the object is in a committed state.Clean:The session is clean after committing, and the object is no longer dirty.Understanding these states helps you manage your data effectively when working with SQLAlchemy ORM.

Understanding when to flush and commit is essential for data integrity.Events and Hooks: SQLAlchemy provides a rich set of events and hooks, allowing customization of state management behaviors to suit specific application needs.Assume you have aUsermodel representing users in a database:from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Sequence\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\n# Define the User model\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('user_id_seq'), primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String(50))\n    age = Column(Integer)\n\n# Create an SQLite in-memory database and bind the engine\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')\n\n# Create the 'users' table in the database\nBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\n\n# Create a Session class to interact with the database\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()Now, let\u2019s explore state management:# Create a new user and add it to the session\nnew_user = User(name='John Doe', age=25)\nsession.add(new_user)\n\n# At this point, the user is in the 'Pending' state, not yet committed to the database\n\n# Query the user (this will trigger a flush to the database)\nqueried_user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()\n\n# The queried_user is now in the 'Persistent' state, representing a database record\n\n# Modify the user's age\nqueried_user.age = 26\n\n# At this point, SQLAlchemy has marked the user as 'Dirty' because it has been modified\n\n# Commit the changes to the database\nsession.commit()\n\n# Now, the changes are saved to the database, and the user is in the 'Committed' state\n\n# The session is now in a 'Clean' state, and the user is no longer marked as 'Dirty'In this example:Pending:When a new user is added to the session, it is in a pending state.Persistent:After querying a user from the database, it becomes persistent.Dirty:If you modify a persistent object, it becomes dirty.Committed:After committing changes, the object is in a committed state.Clean:The session is clean after committing, and the object is no longer dirty.Understanding these states helps you manage your data effectively when working with SQLAlchemy ORM.

    "Object-Relational Mapping(ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. When talking about ORM, most people are referring to alibrarythat implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase \u201can ORM\u201d.An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don\u2019t use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an object in the same language you\u2019re using.For example, here is a completely imaginary case with a pseudo language:You have a book class, you want to retrieve all the books of which the author is \u201cbiko\u201d. Manually, you would do something like that:book_list = new List();\nsql = \"SELECT book FROM library WHERE author = 'biko'\";\ndata = query(sql); // I over simplify ...\nwhile (row = data.next())\n{\n     book = new Book();\n     book.setAuthor(row.get('author');\n     book_list.add(book);\n}SQLAlchemySQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.Managing the state of your data is crucial for robust applications, and SQLAlchemy ORM offers a powerful toolkit for handling this with elegance and efficiency. \ud83d\udcbcIn SQLAlchemy, the ORM layer helps us bridge the gap between the relational database and our Python code, making it seamless to work with database records as Python objects. \ud83d\udc0dKey points on state management with SQLAlchemy ORM:Identity Map Pattern: SQLAlchemy keeps track of objects in a unit of work using the Identity Map pattern.

Understanding when to flush and commit is essential for data integrity.Events and Hooks: SQLAlchemy provides a rich set of events and hooks, allowing customization of state management behaviors to suit specific application needs.Assume you have aUsermodel representing users in a database:from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Sequence\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\n# Define the User model\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('user_id_seq'), primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String(50))\n    age = Column(Integer)\n\n# Create an SQLite in-memory database and bind the engine\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')\n\n# Create the 'users' table in the database\nBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\n\n# Create a Session class to interact with the database\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()Now, let\u2019s explore state management:# Create a new user and add it to the session\nnew_user = User(name='John Doe', age=25)\nsession.add(new_user)\n\n# At this point, the user is in the 'Pending' state, not yet committed to the database\n\n# Query the user (this will trigger a flush to the database)\nqueried_user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()\n\n# The queried_user is now in the 'Persistent' state, representing a database record\n\n# Modify the user's age\nqueried_user.age = 26\n\n# At this point, SQLAlchemy has marked the user as 'Dirty' because it has been modified\n\n# Commit the changes to the database\nsession.commit()\n\n# Now, the changes are saved to the database, and the user is in the 'Committed' state\n\n# The session is now in a 'Clean' state, and the user is no longer marked as 'Dirty'In this example:Pending:When a new user is added to the session, it is in a pending state.Persistent:After querying a user from the database, it becomes persistent.Dirty:If you modify a persistent object, it becomes dirty.Committed:After committing changes, the object is in a committed state.Clean:The session is clean after committing, and the object is no longer dirty.Understanding these states helps you manage your data effectively when working with SQLAlchemy ORM.

    "Object-Relational Mapping(ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. When talking about ORM, most people are referring to alibrarythat implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase \u201can ORM\u201d.An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don\u2019t use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an object in the same language you\u2019re using.For example, here is a completely imaginary case with a pseudo language:You have a book class, you want to retrieve all the books of which the author is \u201cbiko\u201d. Manually, you would do something like that:book_list = new List();\nsql = \"SELECT book FROM library WHERE author = 'biko'\";\ndata = query(sql); // I over simplify ...\nwhile (row = data.next())\n{\n     book = new Book();\n     book.setAuthor(row.get('author');\n     book_list.add(book);\n}SQLAlchemySQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.Managing the state of your data is crucial for robust applications, and SQLAlchemy ORM offers a powerful toolkit for handling this with elegance and efficiency. \ud83d\udcbcIn SQLAlchemy, the ORM layer helps us bridge the gap between the relational database and our Python code, making it seamless to work with database records as Python objects. \ud83d\udc0dKey points on state management with SQLAlchemy ORM:Identity Map Pattern: SQLAlchemy keeps track of objects in a unit of work using the Identity Map pattern.

    "FacebookLinkedInTwitterWhatsappPinterestIn ourProduct Design(UI/UX) class at Moringa School, our Technical Mentor,Silas Silkhe, challenged us to devise design solutions that tackle this issue while upholding essential design principles. Our collaborative effort, involvingAmy,Stephen, and myself, led to the development of these solutions.To illustrate our concepts, we also worked together on a low-fidelity prototype showcasing how our proposals could be effectively implemented.Proposed Solutions in 5 partsLike any other app, the initial step involves signing up into the platform.After accessing the app, here comes the first proposal.1.Identity Verification FeatureImplementing ID/passport identification would ensure that only adults can create and set up accounts. This would also deter spam and bot accounts since each ID would be linked to a unique user, making user tracking more straightforward.2.Family sharing accountsTo maintain a family-friendly environment, we propose enhancing the existing family-sharing feature. During onboarding, underage users can select their age group by scanning their parent\u2019s account, allowing for age-appropriate content access. For underage users, this will lead them to either  \u2018Kidtok\u2019 or \u2018Teentok\u2019.\u2018Kidtok\u2019(ages 5-12) offers locked features that give families direct control over what children can watch, accessible via a PIN resettable monthly. The content here includes cartoons and lighthearted comedy.\u2018Teentok\u2019(ages 13-17) features content that appeals to teenagers, such as dance challenges, lip sync, fashion, travel, education, comedy, relationships, mental health, gaming, and more.On \u2018Kidtok\u2019 and \u2018Teentok,\u2019 only \u2018like\u2018 and \u2018comment\u2018 buttons will be available to reduce objectification and predatory behavior. This limits inappropriate content sharing, addressing past privacy and violation concerns.For adults, TikTok remains a hub of laughter, fun and engaging conversations. Adult users are free to tweak their content preferences as they use the app. In the initial sign-up process, the content preferences page will look as below.3. Live Steaming LatencyStream\u00a0latency\u00a0is the\u00a0delay\u00a0between a camera capturing an event and the event being displayed to viewers.This streaming delay is designed to provide TikTok\u2019s algorithm with an opportunity to evaluate the content being broadcasted, particularly in cases involving explicit content, which has been a significant concern on Kenyan TikTok. We recommend implementing a 15-60 second delay for all live content streams.This approach to latency timelines empowers TikTok to maintain a vigilant watch over content, promptly identifying and addressing any potential violations of guidelines.4.Introducing \u2018Incognitok\u2019Also referred to as \u2018Incognito Mode/Adult Mode. This feature effectively separates potentially sensitive or explicit content from the rest of the platform, granting users greater control over their content experience.Content on \u201cIncognitok\u201d will be marked and restricted to users who have verified their age and consented to view such content. Some of the topics on this side of the app will be what is considered potentially upsetting to other users such as extreme sports, medical procedures, sensitive topics such as violence, and some mental health topics \u2013 among others. It\u2019s important to ensure that the use of \u201cIncognitok\u201d aligns with platform guidelines and local regulations.\u2018Incognitok\u2019 homepage will look like this.Access to this feature is contingent upon age verification, as outlined earlier in the post. While using \u2018Incognitok,\u2019 your content consumption will not influence or impact your account\u2019s search and watch history, ensuring privacy and content separation.5.Well-being pop-upThis proposal tackles addiction concerns and prioritizes user well-being. Presently, this feature can be enabled within TikTok\u2019s settings, but its inconspicuous nature may inadvertently encourage excessive use, potentially resembling a dark pattern in app design.Our solution proposes the inclusion of a built-in timer for first-time users, triggered after 45 minutes of continuous activity, reminding them to take a wellness break. After encountering the initial pop-up, users have the option to disable or personalize this feature according to their preferences. Offering an exit point from the app aligns with well-being guidelines, fostering a responsible platform that promotes mental health and balanced usage.ConclusionOverall, these solutions address various issues, including user safety, age-appropriate content, and well-being. However, their success will depend on the effective implementation, clear communication of changes to users, and continuous monitoring and improvement of these features.Additionally, collaborating with local stakeholders and considering cultural sensitivities in Kenya will be essential to ensure that the solutions align with the needs and values of the Kenyan user base.Would you like to create or improve digital products like apps and websites?

Our collaborative effort, involvingAmy,Stephen, and myself, led to the development of these solutions.To illustrate our concepts, we also worked together on a low-fidelity prototype showcasing how our proposals could be effectively implemented.Proposed Solutions in 5 partsLike any other app, the initial step involves signing up into the platform.After accessing the app, here comes the first proposal.1.Identity Verification FeatureImplementing ID/passport identification would ensure that only adults can create and set up accounts. This would also deter spam and bot accounts since each ID would be linked to a unique user, making user tracking more straightforward.2.Family sharing accountsTo maintain a family-friendly environment, we propose enhancing the existing family-sharing feature. During onboarding, underage users can select their age group by scanning their parent\u2019s account, allowing for age-appropriate content access. For underage users, this will lead them to either  \u2018Kidtok\u2019 or \u2018Teentok\u2019.\u2018Kidtok\u2019(ages 5-12) offers locked features that give families direct control over what children can watch, accessible via a PIN resettable monthly. The content here includes cartoons and lighthearted comedy.\u2018Teentok\u2019(ages 13-17) features content that appeals to teenagers, such as dance challenges, lip sync, fashion, travel, education, comedy, relationships, mental health, gaming, and more.On \u2018Kidtok\u2019 and \u2018Teentok,\u2019 only \u2018like\u2018 and \u2018comment\u2018 buttons will be available to reduce objectification and predatory behavior. This limits inappropriate content sharing, addressing past privacy and violation concerns.For adults, TikTok remains a hub of laughter, fun and engaging conversations. Adult users are free to tweak their content preferences as they use the app. In the initial sign-up process, the content preferences page will look as below.3. Live Steaming LatencyStream\u00a0latency\u00a0is the\u00a0delay\u00a0between a camera capturing an event and the event being displayed to viewers.This streaming delay is designed to provide TikTok\u2019s algorithm with an opportunity to evaluate the content being broadcasted, particularly in cases involving explicit content, which has been a significant concern on Kenyan TikTok. We recommend implementing a 15-60 second delay for all live content streams.This approach to latency timelines empowers TikTok to maintain a vigilant watch over content, promptly identifying and addressing any potential violations of guidelines.4.Introducing \u2018Incognitok\u2019Also referred to as \u2018Incognito Mode/Adult Mode. This feature effectively separates potentially sensitive or explicit content from the rest of the platform, granting users greater control over their content experience.Content on \u201cIncognitok\u201d will be marked and restricted to users who have verified their age and consented to view such content. Some of the topics on this side of the app will be what is considered potentially upsetting to other users such as extreme sports, medical procedures, sensitive topics such as violence, and some mental health topics \u2013 among others. It\u2019s important to ensure that the use of \u201cIncognitok\u201d aligns with platform guidelines and local regulations.\u2018Incognitok\u2019 homepage will look like this.Access to this feature is contingent upon age verification, as outlined earlier in the post. While using \u2018Incognitok,\u2019 your content consumption will not influence or impact your account\u2019s search and watch history, ensuring privacy and content separation.5.Well-being pop-upThis proposal tackles addiction concerns and prioritizes user well-being. Presently, this feature can be enabled within TikTok\u2019s settings, but its inconspicuous nature may inadvertently encourage excessive use, potentially resembling a dark pattern in app design.Our solution proposes the inclusion of a built-in timer for first-time users, triggered after 45 minutes of continuous activity, reminding them to take a wellness break. After encountering the initial pop-up, users have the option to disable or personalize this feature according to their preferences. Offering an exit point from the app aligns with well-being guidelines, fostering a responsible platform that promotes mental health and balanced usage.ConclusionOverall, these solutions address various issues, including user safety, age-appropriate content, and well-being. However, their success will depend on the effective implementation, clear communication of changes to users, and continuous monitoring and improvement of these features.Additionally, collaborating with local stakeholders and considering cultural sensitivities in Kenya will be essential to ensure that the solutions align with the needs and values of the Kenyan user base.Would you like to create or improve digital products like apps and websites?

    "In ourProduct Design(UI/UX) class at Moringa School, our Technical Mentor,Silas Silkhe, challenged us to devise design solutions that tackle this issue while upholding essential design principles. Our collaborative effort, involvingAmy,Stephen, and myself, led to the development of these solutions.To illustrate our concepts, we also worked together on a low-fidelity prototype showcasing how our proposals could be effectively implemented.Proposed Solutions in 5 partsLike any other app, the initial step involves signing up into the platform.After accessing the app, here comes the first proposal.1.Identity Verification FeatureImplementing ID/passport identification would ensure that only adults can create and set up accounts. This would also deter spam and bot accounts since each ID would be linked to a unique user, making user tracking more straightforward.2.Family sharing accountsTo maintain a family-friendly environment, we propose enhancing the existing family-sharing feature. During onboarding, underage users can select their age group by scanning their parent\u2019s account, allowing for age-appropriate content access. For underage users, this will lead them to either  \u2018Kidtok\u2019 or \u2018Teentok\u2019.\u2018Kidtok\u2019(ages 5-12) offers locked features that give families direct control over what children can watch, accessible via a PIN resettable monthly. The content here includes cartoons and lighthearted comedy.\u2018Teentok\u2019(ages 13-17) features content that appeals to teenagers, such as dance challenges, lip sync, fashion, travel, education, comedy, relationships, mental health, gaming, and more.On \u2018Kidtok\u2019 and \u2018Teentok,\u2019 only \u2018like\u2018 and \u2018comment\u2018 buttons will be available to reduce objectification and predatory behavior. This limits inappropriate content sharing, addressing past privacy and violation concerns.For adults, TikTok remains a hub of laughter, fun and engaging conversations. Adult users are free to tweak their content preferences as they use the app. In the initial sign-up process, the content preferences page will look as below.3. Live Steaming LatencyStream\u00a0latency\u00a0is the\u00a0delay\u00a0between a camera capturing an event and the event being displayed to viewers.This streaming delay is designed to provide TikTok\u2019s algorithm with an opportunity to evaluate the content being broadcasted, particularly in cases involving explicit content, which has been a significant concern on Kenyan TikTok. We recommend implementing a 15-60 second delay for all live content streams.This approach to latency timelines empowers TikTok to maintain a vigilant watch over content, promptly identifying and addressing any potential violations of guidelines.4.Introducing \u2018Incognitok\u2019Also referred to as \u2018Incognito Mode/Adult Mode. This feature effectively separates potentially sensitive or explicit content from the rest of the platform, granting users greater control over their content experience.Content on \u201cIncognitok\u201d will be marked and restricted to users who have verified their age and consented to view such content. Some of the topics on this side of the app will be what is considered potentially upsetting to other users such as extreme sports, medical procedures, sensitive topics such as violence, and some mental health topics \u2013 among others. It\u2019s important to ensure that the use of \u201cIncognitok\u201d aligns with platform guidelines and local regulations.\u2018Incognitok\u2019 homepage will look like this.Access to this feature is contingent upon age verification, as outlined earlier in the post. While using \u2018Incognitok,\u2019 your content consumption will not influence or impact your account\u2019s search and watch history, ensuring privacy and content separation.5.Well-being pop-upThis proposal tackles addiction concerns and prioritizes user well-being. Presently, this feature can be enabled within TikTok\u2019s settings, but its inconspicuous nature may inadvertently encourage excessive use, potentially resembling a dark pattern in app design.Our solution proposes the inclusion of a built-in timer for first-time users, triggered after 45 minutes of continuous activity, reminding them to take a wellness break. After encountering the initial pop-up, users have the option to disable or personalize this feature according to their preferences. Offering an exit point from the app aligns with well-being guidelines, fostering a responsible platform that promotes mental health and balanced usage.ConclusionOverall, these solutions address various issues, including user safety, age-appropriate content, and well-being. However, their success will depend on the effective implementation, clear communication of changes to users, and continuous monitoring and improvement of these features.Additionally, collaborating with local stakeholders and considering cultural sensitivities in Kenya will be essential to ensure that the solutions align with the needs and values of the Kenyan user base.Would you like to create or improve digital products like apps and websites?

Can you tell us about your background and what led you to pursue a career in tech?I\u2019m currently in my fourth year, pursuing a BSc in Telecommunication and Information Engineering at JKUAT. My journey into the world of tech started with a nudge from my co-founder, who had a deep passion for programming. His enthusiasm rubbed off on me, and I took the plunge.2. How did you first learn about Moringa School, and what motivated you to enroll in the software engineering program?We stumbled upon Moringa School through Twitter, and what really drew me was the unique learning model specifically how they delivered the programs through remote learning. It seemed like a fantastic opportunity to acquire the skills I needed while still being able to learn from the comfort of my own space.3. What specific skills and knowledge did you gain from Moringa School that you believe contributed to your success in the hackathon?Certainly! Beyond thetechnical coding skills, Moringa School placed a strong emphasis on honing soft skills. My Technical Mentor, Faith Kilonzi, encouraged me to not only code but also to pitch my ideas and teach others. These communication and presentation skills were invaluable during the hackathon.4. Could you describe the solution you and your team presented at the Code Cash Crop 4.0 Hackathon?At the hackathon, we showcased \u201cMche,\u201d a solution designed to support farmers. Our platform offers advisory information to help farmers choose the right crops and timing. Farmers can purchase input supplies conveniently and sell their produce at competitive prices through Mche. Additionally, we\u2019ve created a supportive community where farmers can connect with each other, and we\u2019ve even integrated an AI assistant to answer their questions.Incorporating tech and agriculture will fundamentally alter how food is produced, distributed, and managed in Africa, ensuring sustainability and food security.5. How did Moringa School prepare you for the intense competition and pitch presentation at the hackathon?Moringa School equipped us with the technical skills & tools we needed, like React JS and Rails, which we used to build our project. Additionally, it was through Moringa that I connected with my talented team members, including my co-founder Kiprotich Kimutai, ourdata scientistsAmos Kibet and Scholar Chepkirui, who are Moringa School graduates themselves, and our UI/UX designer, Emma Neema. These connections were instrumental in our success.6. What were the key challenges you faced during the hackathon, and how did your Moringa School training help you overcome them?Our main challenge revolved around the financial feasibility of our solution. Thanks to my time at Moringa, I was well-prepared to address these challenges. We invested time to practice our pitch, work on the business pitch decks and create business models after every capstone project, which came in handy during the hackathon.7. Were there any specific mentors or instructors at Moringa School who played a pivotal role in your journey leading up to the hackathon?Absolutely, I\u2019d like to give special thanks to Albert Bryon, one of the judges and a Technical Mentor at Moringa, and Faith Kilonzi for their guidance. I\u2019d also like to express my gratitude to Stella Ngina from the Outcomes Team who shared the hackathon opportunity with us.8. Winning the hackathon is a significant achievement. How do you see this victory impacting your future career and goals?Winning the hackathon has been a huge confidence boost. It\u2019s a clear reminder that with dedication, I can achieve anything I set my mind to. This victory has set a high bar for my future endeavors, and I\u2019m eager to take on more challenges.9. What advice would you give to aspiring tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs looking to make a difference in the agriculture and technology sectors, especially those considering enrolling in Moringa School?I would advice techies to just start and build in public, be proud of their work and post it on Twitter and Linkedin. The importance of sharing your work on these platforms is that you can interact with other developers and get feedback on how to improve your work.10. As a parting shot, what is a quote you live by?There is one Steve Maraboli quote that I purpose to embody.\u2018Live your truth. Express your love. Share your enthusiasm. Take action towards your dreams. Walk your talk. Dance and sing to your music. Embrace your blessings. Make today worth remembering.\u201911. As we conclude, your story is truly inspiring, and there are individuals who may wish to connect with you for mentorship or opportunities.

My Technical Mentor, Faith Kilonzi, encouraged me to not only code but also to pitch my ideas and teach others. These communication and presentation skills were invaluable during the hackathon.4. Could you describe the solution you and your team presented at the Code Cash Crop 4.0 Hackathon?At the hackathon, we showcased \u201cMche,\u201d a solution designed to support farmers. Our platform offers advisory information to help farmers choose the right crops and timing. Farmers can purchase input supplies conveniently and sell their produce at competitive prices through Mche. Additionally, we\u2019ve created a supportive community where farmers can connect with each other, and we\u2019ve even integrated an AI assistant to answer their questions.Incorporating tech and agriculture will fundamentally alter how food is produced, distributed, and managed in Africa, ensuring sustainability and food security.5. How did Moringa School prepare you for the intense competition and pitch presentation at the hackathon?Moringa School equipped us with the technical skills & tools we needed, like React JS and Rails, which we used to build our project. Additionally, it was through Moringa that I connected with my talented team members, including my co-founder Kiprotich Kimutai, ourdata scientistsAmos Kibet and Scholar Chepkirui, who are Moringa School graduates themselves, and our UI/UX designer, Emma Neema. These connections were instrumental in our success.6. What were the key challenges you faced during the hackathon, and how did your Moringa School training help you overcome them?Our main challenge revolved around the financial feasibility of our solution. Thanks to my time at Moringa, I was well-prepared to address these challenges. We invested time to practice our pitch, work on the business pitch decks and create business models after every capstone project, which came in handy during the hackathon.7. Were there any specific mentors or instructors at Moringa School who played a pivotal role in your journey leading up to the hackathon?Absolutely, I\u2019d like to give special thanks to Albert Bryon, one of the judges and a Technical Mentor at Moringa, and Faith Kilonzi for their guidance. I\u2019d also like to express my gratitude to Stella Ngina from the Outcomes Team who shared the hackathon opportunity with us.8. Winning the hackathon is a significant achievement.

It\u2019s a clear reminder that with dedication, I can achieve anything I set my mind to. This victory has set a high bar for my future endeavors, and I\u2019m eager to take on more challenges.9. What advice would you give to aspiring tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs looking to make a difference in the agriculture and technology sectors, especially those considering enrolling in Moringa School?I would advice techies to just start and build in public, be proud of their work and post it on Twitter and Linkedin. The importance of sharing your work on these platforms is that you can interact with other developers and get feedback on how to improve your work.10. As a parting shot, what is a quote you live by?There is one Steve Maraboli quote that I purpose to embody.\u2018Live your truth. Express your love. Share your enthusiasm.

It\u2019s a clear reminder that with dedication, I can achieve anything I set my mind to. This victory has set a high bar for my future endeavors, and I\u2019m eager to take on more challenges.9. What advice would you give to aspiring tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs looking to make a difference in the agriculture and technology sectors, especially those considering enrolling in Moringa School?I would advice techies to just start and build in public, be proud of their work and post it on Twitter and Linkedin. The importance of sharing your work on these platforms is that you can interact with other developers and get feedback on how to improve your work.10. As a parting shot, what is a quote you live by?There is one Steve Maraboli quote that I purpose to embody.\u2018Live your truth. Express your love. Share your enthusiasm. Take action towards your dreams. Walk your talk. Dance and sing to your music. Embrace your blessings. Make today worth remembering.\u201911.

    "1. Can you tell us about your background and what led you to pursue a career in tech?I\u2019m currently in my fourth year, pursuing a BSc in Telecommunication and Information Engineering at JKUAT. My journey into the world of tech started with a nudge from my co-founder, who had a deep passion for programming. His enthusiasm rubbed off on me, and I took the plunge.2. How did you first learn about Moringa School, and what motivated you to enroll in the software engineering program?We stumbled upon Moringa School through Twitter, and what really drew me was the unique learning model specifically how they delivered the programs through remote learning. It seemed like a fantastic opportunity to acquire the skills I needed while still being able to learn from the comfort of my own space.3. What specific skills and knowledge did you gain from Moringa School that you believe contributed to your success in the hackathon?Certainly! Beyond thetechnical coding skills, Moringa School placed a strong emphasis on honing soft skills. My Technical Mentor, Faith Kilonzi, encouraged me to not only code but also to pitch my ideas and teach others. These communication and presentation skills were invaluable during the hackathon.",

The first step to creating life-changing user experiences using digital products is to understand the difference between these two terms. So let\u2019s dive right in!User Experience (UX)At the crux of every product in the world is the ability to satisfy its users. Regardless of how great your solution is, if your end consumers are dissatisfied with your product, then it will go down the drain. This is the philosophy behind user experience.UX or user experience is the process of crafting seamless user experiences to improve user satisfaction with your digital product \u2013 could be your app or website. This is achieved by boosting the accessibility, usability, and performance of the solution. Overall, users must be pleased when interacting with your product.Exemplary UX is having a user-centred design. Each product design decision must be made after considering the wants and needs of the users. It is noteworthy to mention that UX is not limited to the user\u2019s experience with the product. Instead, it includes the customer\u2019s perception prior to, during, and after the use of the digital solution. This involves crafting a compelling overview of the product, the download process (in the case of an app), and the actual usage, and post-usage with the brand.For example, in the case of an e-commerce website, the user experience will involve the branding efforts of the business, the ease of navigating the site from scrolling through the products to placing an order, and the reviews and push notifications, and emails the brand sends.User Interface (UI)The user interface revolves around the usability of the solution. A product with a great UI will be one that is highly user-friendly and features an efficient interface.A common misconception about UI is that it is only about the development of navigation menus and buttons. However, in reality, it is more complex than this.User Interface includes all interactions between the product and the user. It is about the look and functionality of the product.Continuing with the above example, when making a decision on where to place the cart option on the e-commerce website, developers must consider what position would be optimum for their users. They must also decide the colour scheme to use to help consumers in detecting the presence of the cart.What is more, the developer should ensure that the overall flow of the website makes sense. Having the consumer journey mapped out simplifies the interface design process.Main Difference Between UI & UXWhile UI consists of the technical elements that allow users to interact with the solution, UX involves the overall perception of the user takes away from the experience with the app.Taking Google for example, the user interface of the platform is simplistic. It is designed to enable users to get information quickly. If the search engine featured a high load time, hampering the users\u2019 ability to access information, the user experience would be compromised.Besides the basic difference, here are other ways UX and UX differ from one another:UI focuses on product performance while UX focuses on the entire user journey.UI determines how the app will look, while UX determines what problem it will solve in the users\u2019 life.UI revolves around visually directing the users around the app/website interface while UX includes researching, testing, developing, and prototyping the product.While UI is limited to the screen, UX transcends it and includes all interactions and touchpoints of the user.The OverlapThe reason why many people consider UX and UI to be synonymous is that quality apps/websites must include both. Without proper UX, UI is guaranteed to be compromised.Why?When interacting with a digital product, users require the platform to be user-friendly and efficient to call the experience smooth and convenient. Therefore, usability plays a crucial role in attaining optimum user experiences.Final ThoughtsIt is imperative to understand that UX is above and beyond the product\u2019s performance \u2013 and UI is more than the buttons added.

The first step to creating life-changing user experiences using digital products is to understand the difference between these two terms. So let\u2019s dive right in!User Experience (UX)At the crux of every product in the world is the ability to satisfy its users. Regardless of how great your solution is, if your end consumers are dissatisfied with your product, then it will go down the drain. This is the philosophy behind user experience.UX or user experience is the process of crafting seamless user experiences to improve user satisfaction with your digital product \u2013 could be your app or website. This is achieved by boosting the accessibility, usability, and performance of the solution. Overall, users must be pleased when interacting with your product.Exemplary UX is having a user-centred design. Each product design decision must be made after considering the wants and needs of the users. It is noteworthy to mention that UX is not limited to the user\u2019s experience with the product. Instead, it includes the customer\u2019s perception prior to, during, and after the use of the digital solution. This involves crafting a compelling overview of the product, the download process (in the case of an app), and the actual usage, and post-usage with the brand.For example, in the case of an e-commerce website, the user experience will involve the branding efforts of the business, the ease of navigating the site from scrolling through the products to placing an order, and the reviews and push notifications, and emails the brand sends.User Interface (UI)The user interface revolves around the usability of the solution. A product with a great UI will be one that is highly user-friendly and features an efficient interface.A common misconception about UI is that it is only about the development of navigation menus and buttons. However, in reality, it is more complex than this.User Interface includes all interactions between the product and the user. It is about the look and functionality of the product.Continuing with the above example, when making a decision on where to place the cart option on the e-commerce website, developers must consider what position would be optimum for their users. They must also decide the colour scheme to use to help consumers in detecting the presence of the cart.What is more, the developer should ensure that the overall flow of the website makes sense. Having the consumer journey mapped out simplifies the interface design process.Main Difference Between UI & UXWhile UI consists of the technical elements that allow users to interact with the solution, UX involves the overall perception of the user takes away from the experience with the app.Taking Google for example, the user interface of the platform is simplistic. It is designed to enable users to get information quickly. If the search engine featured a high load time, hampering the users\u2019 ability to access information, the user experience would be compromised.Besides the basic difference, here are other ways UX and UX differ from one another:UI focuses on product performance while UX focuses on the entire user journey.UI determines how the app will look, while UX determines what problem it will solve in the users\u2019 life.UI revolves around visually directing the users around the app/website interface while UX includes researching, testing, developing, and prototyping the product.While UI is limited to the screen, UX transcends it and includes all interactions and touchpoints of the user.The OverlapThe reason why many people consider UX and UI to be synonymous is that quality apps/websites must include both. Without proper UX, UI is guaranteed to be compromised.Why?When interacting with a digital product, users require the platform to be user-friendly and efficient to call the experience smooth and convenient. Therefore, usability plays a crucial role in attaining optimum user experiences.Final ThoughtsIt is imperative to understand that UX is above and beyond the product\u2019s performance \u2013 and UI is more than the buttons added.
