– Best Practices for Safeguarding Your Data I developed an interest in Data Science and I started looking at options on where I could do
it. Moringa School came to mind because I had heard of so many good reviews about their programs. My initial expectation was that I would
be here to learn more about exploratory data analysis and understand more about machine learning using R.Carol WambuiData Science
Masterclass Student Market-aligned Programs Applications for this course have been closed. Employment Rate When I joined Moringa School, I
was quite overwhelmed at first because it’s fast-paced and it’s not like the traditional learning model I was used to. Here we have
Technical Mentors who guide you through the curriculum and are there if you need any help. They encourage you to think for yourself, take
initiative and they guide you with your own learning pace. See, I’m not a math person but I managed to do this as I’m surrounded by very
smart and passionate people who always support me. Through support and consistent practice, I have been able to understand the concept of
Data Science and apply it in various scenarios. It’s actually a very interesting and fun concept as here, we’re able to experiment with
different, real-life data sets.Rose Delilah – Moringa School TM The quality of our programs and their impact on learners is a direct

everythingBeing a data scientist entails dealing with all aspects of a project. Often, in big companies, team leaders in charge of people
with specialized skills are data scientists; their skill set allows them to overlook a project and guide them from start to finish.Data
Analysts prepare reports that effectively show the trends and insights gathered from their analysis.Data analysts are responsible for
different tasks such as visualizing, transforming and manipulating the data. Sometimes they are also responsible for web analytics
tracking and A/B testing analysis.Data engineers are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines.They need to test
ecosystems for the businesses and prepare them for data scientists to run their algorithms. In short, they make sure that the data is
ready to be processed and analyzed.Data Storytellers find the narrative that best describes the data to express it to stakeholdersData
Storytelling lies right in the middle of pure, raw data and human communication. A data storyteller needs to take on some data, simplify
it, focus it on a specific aspect, analyze its behavior, and use his insights to create a compelling story that helps people better
understand the data. Course Prerequisites Cybersecurity Prep Corporate Courses Become aCertified Data Scientistwith access to 12 months of

fit for the role, you will have an opportunity to meet some of the team members to give us insight on your working style, your values, how
you build and sustain relationships, and how all these aspects meshes with our organization.5OfferThe final stage is an offer to our top
